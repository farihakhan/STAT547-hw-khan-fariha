Read and work the exercises in the [Strings chapter]http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html or R for Data Science.

Created a function to work with gapminder data.

#### 5. Work with a list
#### 6. Work with a nested data frame

## Progres 
I chose to go through the strings chapter from R for Data Science. This part of the assignment took a really long time to do. There were a few exercises I wasn't able to figure out how to do properly. After finishing this part, I wish I had chosen a different section. 
Creating the function was pretty straightforward. I tried to add more to my first function by allowing the input to be in any case. I don't have too much else to report.. other than the exercises just took a REALLY long time.
