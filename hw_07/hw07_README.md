Progress report:
This assignment was fairly easy, except I couldn't fully figure out how to get the makefile to structure everything into my RMD so I ended up using source. The actual makefile did work in creating all of the files though. I wanted to try to incorporate a function into my script so I could call it into the RMD. I also noticed that the "clear" command didn't work - I ended up with duplicate firgures.
