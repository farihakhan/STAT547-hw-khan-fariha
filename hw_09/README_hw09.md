### [Assignment overview](http://stat545.com/hw09_package.html)
### Your mission

#### [x] Define and export at least one new function, i.e. make it available to a user

#### [x] Give function arguments sensible defaults, where relevant.

#### [x] Use assertions to add some validity checks of function input.

#### [x] Document all exported functions.

#### [x] Include at least three unit tests for every function that is exported.
#### There should be at least one expectation for success and one for failure.

#### [x] Your package should pass check() without errors (warnings and notes are OK, though it would be great if there were none).

#### [x] Keep updating the README and vignette to show usage of all the functions in the package. 

#### [x] Push your package to GitHub

#### [x] Write your reflections in a document in your normal STAT 545/547 course repo and open the usual issue there. Make sure to provide a link to your package, so TAs/prof/peers can find it for review! 
 
### Progress report + Resources

I found the first part of this assignment to be quite straightforward. Instead of cloning the powers repo, I started from scratch and used it as an outline. This really helped me understand the structure of an R package. 

Working through the class example, and expanding on it was quite straight forward. I wanted to add a function that gave the resultant of a quadratic equation. This was quite challenging for a few reason. A) I haven't done math in many years, so it took me some time to learn the basics again. B) Because the function I wrote had if() statements, I had some trouble getting it to work and output what I wanted. This also made my test_quadrtc.R file not really work properly. I had to simplify is try to get the function, and package, working properly. I also got a little lost with moving my repos around. 

Otherwise I found this assignment to be really educational. I mostly used our [class notes](http://stat545.com/cm109-110-notes_and_exercises.html#adding-data-to-your-r-package) to work through this problem. I also spent a lot of time on highschool level [math lessons](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biomath/tutorials/Quadratic/Roots.html) to relearn the quadratic equation. I still haven't fully figured out how to graph it within the nested function yet though.
