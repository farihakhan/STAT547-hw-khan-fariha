# Homework 8: Building Shiny apps
# Fariha Khan

## Assignment overview

#### Build a new Shiny app

For the homework, you need to either develop a new Shiny app, using your preferred dataset (or one you want to know more about). If you are short on ideas, you can instead add 3 or more features to the BC Liquor Store app we developed together.

### Building details
Regardless of whether you create a new app or just add new features to our BC Liquor Store app, you must do the following 5 things:

 1. Your app should be split into a ui.R file and a server.R file.

 2. Your app should be deployed online on shinyapps.io. Make sure your app actually works online (sometimes your app will work in RStudio but will have errors on shinyapps.io - make sure you deploy early and often to make debugging easier).
 
 - Try getting your own Shiny Server and host your app yourself. Read this tutorial for help on setting that up.
 
 3. Add a README.md file to your Shiny app folder in your course repository. In the README.md you should describe your app and add a link to the URL where the app is hosted.
 
 4. Include the code for your Shiny app in your repository, as the marker will need to review your code.
 
 5. Whatever dataset you will use, acknowledge its source clearly and extensively. Remember that we value open, reproducible science: this means that the user of your app should have direct access to the data, or know where to go to access it.
