# Homework 8: Building Shiny apps
# Fariha Khan

## [Assignment overview](http://stat545.com/hw08_shiny.html)

#### Task: Build a new Shiny app

*For the homework, you need to either develop a new Shiny app, using your preferred dataset (or one you want to know more about). If you are short on ideas, you can instead add 3 or more features to the BC Liquor Store app we developed together.*

I chose to:

 - Add an image of the BC Liquor logo
 
 - Show the number of results found whenever the filters change
 
 - Allow the user to search for multiple alcohol types simultaneously
 
 

### Overview
I used the BCL data set to build my app. I used the foundation of what we covered in class, 
and customized it by adding some features. 
You can see the modifications I made [here.]( https://farihakhan.shinyapps.io/bcl_app/)
